# Interview-Challenge-Mohit-Sharma

### Implemented requested functionalities, other CRUD operations (delete and update not fully implemented or tested) 
### Used UTF7 encoding (obsolete) while reading csv to ensure names with special characters are read properly.  
### UTF8 was unable to read special characters, different encoding scheme could be implemented with more research.

### Screenshots of output attached in documentation

### Basic frontend created (Not created separate components to handle errors basic messages implemented)

### After uploading csv it redirects to the screen to display data.

### I have implemented all the required functionalities with best of my abilities any feedback is appreaciated.

## Thanks for this opportunity
